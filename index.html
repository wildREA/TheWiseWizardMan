    <h1>Privacy Policy for TheWiseWizardMan</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TheWiseWizardMan is a Discord bot created to check the age of Discord servers. This privacy policy outlines how data is handled, which includes only the current server’s age and the current time in UTC for calculation purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>TheWiseWizardMan only collects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current server's age.</li>
      <li>The current time in UTC to calculate the server’s age.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other data is collected by the bot.</p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The collected data (server’s age and UTC time) is used solely for calculating and displaying the server’s age within the Discord server. This data is not shared with any third parties, nor is it retained.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>No data is stored by TheWiseWizardMan. All calculations are performed in real-time, and no data is saved or archived.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Removal</h2>
    <p>Since no data is stored, there is no data to delete, and retention of data is not applicable.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>No data security measures are needed as no data is stored. The only information displayed is the server’s age in a public Discord channel at the server user’s discretion.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Updated versions will be made available here to keep users informed of any changes.</p>
