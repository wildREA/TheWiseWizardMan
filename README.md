# Privacy Policy for TheWiseWizardMan

## Introduction
TheWiseWizardMan is a Discord bot created to check the age of Discord servers. This privacy policy outlines how data is handled, which includes only the current server’s age and the current time in UTC for calculation purposes.

## Data Collection
TheWiseWizardMan only collects:
- The current server's age.
- The current time in UTC to calculate the server’s age.

No other data is collected by the bot.

## Data Usage
The collected data (server’s age and UTC time) is used solely for the purpose of calculating and displaying the server’s age within the Discord server. This data is not shared with any third parties, nor will it be retained beyond the moment it is used.

## Data Storage
No data is stored by TheWiseWizardMan. All calculations are performed in real-time, and no data is saved or archived.

## Data Retention and Removal
Since no data is stored, there is no data to delete, and retention of data is not applicable.

## Data Security
Since TheWiseWizardMan does not store data, there are no security measures needed to protect data that is not stored. The only information publicly available is the server’s age displayed in a Discord channel, as determined by the server user.
